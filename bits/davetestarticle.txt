JOE Bloggs was last night sensationally crowned cha-cha-champion of TV dance show Strictly Come Dancing.
Joe, 29, astonished millions as he stormed onto the stage for Saturday night's final - then BEAT pop star Alesha Dixon and Eastenders favourite Matt di Angelo to the coveted title.
The builder, of Shiplake, Oxon - who was in the audience celebrating his birthday - wowed the judges with his fancy footwork and special moves including the 'lasso', the 'robot' and the 'funky chicken'. 
Married dad-of-eight Joe last night said: "Everyone knows the power of my moves, and tonight they finally got the recognition they deserved."
Snake-hipped Joe was in Boogie Wonderland as all four judges gave him perfect scores - an unstoppable score that made actor Matt break down and blub like a baby.
Judge Len Goodman raved: "It is rare to see the funky chicken performed with such flair and panache. Ten out of ten."
